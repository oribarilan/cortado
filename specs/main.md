# Cortado Spec

Cortado is a cross-platform extensible watcher that lives in the macOS menubar.
It gives developers a persistent, glanceable view of things they care about.

## Terminology

See `specs/glossary.md` for canonical definitions of all terms (Feed, Activity, Field, Status Kind, Status Value, etc.).

### Hierarchy

```
Feed: "GitHub PRs — personal/cortado"
  |-- Activity: PR #42 "Add feed scaffold"
  |     |-- Field: review    = awaiting   (status)
  |     |-- Field: checks    = passing    (status)
  |     |-- Field: mergeable = yes        (status)
  |     '-- Field: labels    = ["wip"]    (text)
  |
  '-- Activity: PR #38 "Fix tray icon"
        '-- Field: review    = approved   (status)
```

## Architecture

### Feed system

A **Feed** is the core extensibility unit. Each feed type:

1. Defines what **fields** it provides (with types and defaults).
2. Implements a **poll** method that discovers/updates activities.
3. Is configured via the user's config file.

Feed types ship as curated implementations in Rust. There is no external plugin system.

### Feed trait contract

Every feed implementation must:

- Accept structured config from the TOML file.
- Declare its provided fields (name, label, type, description).
- Poll and return a list of activities, each with populated fields.
- Manage activity lifecycle (new, updated, gone).

### Feed identity

Feed names must be unique within the config file. The name is the feed's identity — duplicate names are a config error.

### GitHub authentication

The `github-pr` feed (and future GitHub feed types) depends on the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/) for authentication and API access. Cortado shells out to `gh` commands (for example, `gh pr list` and `gh api`) instead of managing tokens directly. This means:

- No auth config in `feeds.toml`.
- `gh` must be installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).
- If `gh` is not available, GitHub feeds fail with this message: "GitHub feed requires `gh` CLI. Install it from https://cli.github.com/ and run `gh auth login`."
- If `gh` is available but not authenticated, GitHub feeds fail with this message: "GitHub feed requires `gh` authentication. Run `gh auth login` and retry."

### External CLI dependency contract

Feeds that rely on external CLIs must use a consistent dependency/error model:

- Dependency/auth failures are surfaced as **feed-level poll errors** (never app-global crashes).
- Errors are concise and actionable (what is missing + exact command/action to fix).
- Other valid feeds continue polling/rendering even if one feed has missing dependencies.
- Where canonical error copy is defined (as above for `github-pr`), implementations should use it verbatim.

Current dependency requirements:

- `github-pr`: requires `gh` installed and authenticated.
- `ado-pr`: requires `az` CLI, `azure-devops` extension, and authenticated access via `az login`.

#### `ado-pr` dependency checks (contract)

`ado-pr` implementations should follow this dependency preflight order and normalize failures to concise feed-level poll errors:

1. Verify `az` CLI is installed/invocable.
2. Verify `azure-devops` extension is installed (`az extension show --name azure-devops` or equivalent).
3. Verify authentication is available via `az login` state (`az account show` or equivalent).

Failures in any step should not crash the app globally; they should surface on that feed while other feeds continue polling/rendering.

Canonical `ado-pr` dependency/auth error copy:

- Missing `az` CLI: "Azure DevOps feed requires `az` CLI. Install it from https://aka.ms/install-azure-cli and run `az login`."
- Missing extension: "Azure DevOps feed requires `azure-devops` extension. Run `az extension add --name azure-devops`."
- Unauthenticated: "Azure DevOps feed requires `az` authentication. Run `az login` and retry."

### Default intervals

Each feed type defines a default poll interval used when `interval` is omitted from config:

| Feed type | Default interval |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `github-pr` | `"120s"` |
| `ado-pr` | `"120s"` |
| `copilot-session` | `"30s"` |
| `opencode-session` | `"30s"` |
| `cortado-update` | `"6h"` (built-in, not user-configured) |

Intervals use duration strings parsed by `jiff` (for example: `"30s"`, `"5m"`, `"1.5m"`, `"2h"`). Integer seconds are not supported.

### Activity retention

Feeds may opt into retention via `retain`, a duration string on each feed config.

- `retain` omitted ⇒ no retention (default)
- `retain = "2h"` ⇒ keep disappeared activities for up to 2 hours

Retention is a runtime lifecycle primitive:

- On successful poll, activities missing from the new poll result may be retained for the configured window.
- Retained activities are shown in menubar UI with a hollow dot (`◦`) marker.
- Retained activities render after active activities within each feed section.
- Retention is currently in-memory only; retained activities are cleared on app restart.

### Config loading

Config is loaded once at app launch. Changes to `feeds.toml` or `settings.toml` are detected automatically via filesystem watching (using the `notify` crate with 500ms debounce). When a change is detected:

- The on-disk config is parsed and compared to the running config (content comparison, not just mtime).
- If valid and different: a "Cortado Config" feed appears with a restart activity (standard activity with `FeedAction::RestartApp`).
- If invalid TOML: a config error activity is shown (`AttentionNegative` status, no restart action).
- If identical to running config: no prompt (handles no-op saves and GUI saves that already updated in-memory state).

Clicking the restart action (tray, panel, or Settings sidebar) calls `app_handle.restart()`, which relaunches the app with the new config.

#### Which settings need restart

Most settings take effect immediately via the in-memory `AppSettingsState` RwLock and the `appearance-changed` event. The exceptions:

| Setting | Why restart is needed |
|---------|----------------------|
| Feed config (`feeds.toml`) | Feeds are built from the registry at startup and not hot-reloaded. |
| `show_menubar` | The tray icon is created once at startup; there is no dynamic show/hide API. |

All other settings (theme, text size, hotkey, panel options, notifications, focus/agents) apply immediately without restart.

### Error handling

Errors are surfaced per-feed in the UI, never silently swallowed.

- **Bad config** (missing required field, unknown type, duplicate name): the feed card renders the config error message instead of activities. Other valid feeds still load normally.
- **Poll failure** (network error, `gh` not installed, command failed): the feed card shows a feed-level error status. Previous activities may still be displayed if available.

### Field types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `text` | Plain string | `labels: "wip, draft"` |
| `status` | String + status kind (see `specs/status.md`) | `review: awaiting (waiting)` |
| `number` | Numeric value | `response_time: 142` |
| `url` | Clickable link | `link: https://github.com/...` |

### Curated feed types (Phase 1)

| Feed type | Activities | Key fields |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| `github-pr` | Open PRs per user/repo | review (status), checks (status), mergeable (status), draft (status), labels (text) |
| `github-actions` | CI workflow runs per repo | status (status), branch (text), workflow (text), event (text) |
| `ado-pr` | Active Azure DevOps PRs per org/project/repo | review (status), checks (status), mergeable (status), draft (status) |
| `http-health` | Single activity per URL | status (status), response_time (number), status_code (number) |
| `copilot-session` | Active GitHub Copilot CLI sessions | status (status), repo (text), branch (text) |
| `opencode-session` | Active OpenCode coding sessions | status (status), repo (text), branch (text) |

Feed snapshots are capped to at most **20 activities** per feed after retention and ordering are applied.

### Future feed types

- `docker` — running containers. Fields: state (status), health (status), uptime (text), image (text).

## Configuration

### Location

`~/.config/cortado/feeds.toml` — single file, source of truth.

The GUI can also create/edit this file. If the file doesn't exist, Cortado starts with no feeds and can guide the user to create one.

### Format

```toml
[[feed]]
name = "My PRs"
type = "github-pr"
repo = "personal/cortado"
interval = "60s"
retain = "2h"

[[feed]]
name = "ADO PRs"
type = "ado-pr"
url = "https://dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_git/your-repo"
interval = "120s"

# Optional: override field display
[feed.fields.labels]
visible = false

[[feed]]
name = "my ci"
type = "github-actions"
repo = "owner/repo"
branch = "main"           # Optional: only runs on this branch
workflow = "ci.yml"        # Optional: only this workflow file
interval = "120s"

[[feed]]
name = "api health"
type = "http-health"
url = "https://api.example.com/health"
method = "GET"             # Optional: GET (default) or HEAD
timeout = "10s"            # Optional: per-request timeout (default: 10s)
expected_status = 200      # Optional: expected HTTP status code (default: 200)
interval = "60s"

[[feed]]
name = "Copilot"
type = "copilot-session"

[[feed]]
name = "OpenCode"
type = "opencode-session"
```

### Config rules

- `name` and `type` are required on every feed.
- Type-specific fields (e.g., `repo`, `url`) are flat, not nested.
- PR feed types support optional `user` author filter values:
  - `github-pr`: default `@me` when omitted; accepts GitHub login or `@me`
  - `ado-pr`: default `me` when omitted; accepts creator identity (prefer email/UPN) or `me`
- `interval` is a duration string (for example `"30s"`, `"5m"`, `"1.5m"`).
- `retain` is an optional duration string. When omitted, activities are not retained after they disappear from poll results.
- `[feed.fields.<name>]` allows overriding visibility, label, etc.
- The base feed entity defines the field override contract; curated types (like `github-pr`) provide defaults.

### `ado-pr` field mapping contract (initial)

`ado-pr` should map Azure DevOps CLI/REST states deterministically to Cortado status fields.

Review aggregation from reviewer votes (`10`, `5`, `0`, `-5`, `-10`):

- Any `-10` → `rejected` (attention-negative)
- Else any `-5` → `changes requested` (attention-negative)
- Else if all required reviewers have vote `>= 5` → `approved` (attention-positive)
- Else → `awaiting` (waiting)

Mergeable mapping from `mergeStatus`:

- `succeeded` → `yes` (idle)
- `conflicts` → `no` (attention-negative)
- `rejectedByPolicy` → `blocked` (waiting)
- `queued` → `checking` (running)
- `failure` → `failed` (attention-negative)
- `notSet` → `notSet (unknown)` (idle)
- Any unrecognized state `X` → `X (unknown)` (idle)

`ado-pr` polling scope for initial implementation is active PRs only (`--status active`).

Checks rollup from `az repos pr policy list --id <PR_ID>` (CI policies only — Build and Status types; reviewer/approval policies are excluded since the `review` field covers that):

- any `rejected` or `broken` → `failed` (attention-negative)
- any `queued` or `running` with expired build context (`isExpired: true`) → `failed` (attention-negative); ADO auto-requeues builds that may never run (e.g., file-pattern scoped), leaving them as `queued` indefinitely
- else any `queued` or `running` → `running` (running)
- `notApplicable` is ignored in rollup
- else → `succeeded` (idle)
- zero policies or all `notApplicable` → `succeeded` (idle)
- unknown/unexpected states are ignored in rollup; if all non-`notApplicable` policies are unknown, the result is `<state> (unknown)` (idle)
- per-PR policy-call failures produce `unknown` (idle) without failing the whole feed poll
- policy calls use bounded concurrency (max 5 in flight) with the same per-call timeout as the main poll (30s)

### `github-actions` field mapping contract

Uses the `gh` CLI (`gh run list`). Auth and preflight checks are shared with `github-pr` via a common `ensure_gh_available()` helper.

Config fields:

- `repo` (required) — `owner/repo`
- `branch` (optional) — filter to runs on this branch
- `workflow` (optional) — filter to this workflow file
- `event` (optional) — filter by trigger event (push, pull_request, etc.)
- `user` (optional) — filter by triggering user (`@me` or a login)

Default interval: `120s`.

Activity identity: run URL. Activity title: `{workflowName} #{number}` (e.g., `CI #482`).

Provided fields:

| Field      | Type   | Label    | Description      |
|-----------|--------|----------|------------------|
| `status`  | status | Status   | Run status       |
| `branch`  | text   | Branch   | Head branch      |
| `workflow`| text   | Workflow | Workflow name    |
| `event`   | text   | Event    | Trigger event    |

Status mapping from `gh` JSON `status` and `conclusion`:

- `conclusion` in {`failure`, `timed_out`, `startup_failure`} → `failing` (attention-negative)
- `conclusion` = `cancelled` → `cancelled` (attention-negative)
- `status` = `in_progress` → `running` (running)
- `status` in {`queued`, `waiting`, `requested`, `pending`} → `queued` (waiting)
- `conclusion` = `success` → `passing` (idle)
- `conclusion` in {`skipped`, `neutral`} → `skipped` (idle)
- fallback → `unknown` (idle)

### `http-health` field mapping contract

Pure Rust HTTP monitoring using `reqwest` (with `rustls-tls`). No external CLI dependency.

Config fields:

- `url` (required) — HTTP or HTTPS endpoint URL
- `method` (optional) — `GET` (default) or `HEAD`
- `timeout` (optional) — per-request timeout, default `10s`
- `expected_status` (optional) — expected HTTP status code (100-599), default `200`

Default interval: `60s`.

Activity identity: the URL. Activity title: hostname + path (e.g., `api.example.com/health`).

Provided fields:

| Field           | Type   | Label         | Description                    |
|----------------|--------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| `status`       | status | Status        | Endpoint health status         |
| `response_time`| number | Response Time | Response time in milliseconds  |
| `status_code`  | number | Status Code   | HTTP response status code      |

Status mapping:

- Request error (timeout, DNS, connection) → `down` (attention-negative)
- HTTP status != `expected_status` → `unhealthy` (attention-negative)
- HTTP status = `expected_status` → `healthy` (idle)

## Platform

Phase 1 is macOS only. The app runs as an `Accessory` (no dock icon), with a tray icon that opens a menubar-attached panel.

### Tray icon status indicator

The tray icon reflects the global rollup status — the highest-priority `StatusKind` across all activities in all feeds. This makes the menubar icon a passive, glanceable signal of whether anything needs attention.

- When all feeds are **Idle** (or no feeds are configured): the icon uses macOS template mode — a monochrome silhouette that auto-adapts to light/dark menubar. No dot is shown.
- When any feed has a non-Idle status: template mode is disabled and a **colored dot** is composited in the bottom-right corner of the icon. The dot color matches the global rollup status kind (red, yellow, blue, or green). The base icon is tinted for the current menubar theme (white on dark, black on light).
- The dot updates on each poll cycle. The icon is only regenerated when the status or theme changes.
- Theme detection uses the macOS system appearance (`AppleInterfaceStyle`).

### Menubar UX (panel disclosure, Strict System)

- Top level groups by **Feed**.
- Feed headers are non-interactive and visually normal (not disabled-looking).
- Each **Activity** is a compact row prefixed by a derived status dot.
- **Retained Activities** use a hollow dot (`◦`) prefix.
- Retained activities are listed after active activities within each feed.
- Activity rows support inline disclosure.
- Expanding an activity row reveals all **Field** entries (`label: value`) inline.
- Dot color is derived from status kinds using the precedence defined in `specs/status.md`.
- Feed-level config and poll errors are shown inline within the feed section.

## Notifications

Cortado sends macOS Notification Center alerts when activity statuses change. Notification behavior is configurable at two levels: global preferences in `settings.toml` and per-feed toggles in `feeds.toml`.

### Trigger model

Notifications fire when an activity's **rollup kind** changes — the highest-priority `StatusKind` across all its status fields shifts (e.g., Waiting → AttentionNegative). New and removed activities are also optionally notifiable.

### Configuration layers

1. **Global settings** (`~/.config/cortado/settings.toml`) — master toggle, notification mode, delivery preset, new/removed activity toggles.
2. **Per-feed toggle** (`feeds.toml`) — `notify = false` disables notifications for a specific feed. Default is `true` (opt-out model).

### Notification modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `all` (default) | Any rollup kind change fires a notification |
| `escalation_only` | Only when the new kind is higher priority than the old kind |
| `specific_kinds` | Only when the new kind is in the configured set |

### Delivery presets

| Preset | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `grouped` (default) | At most one notification per feed per poll cycle |
| `immediate` | One notification per activity change |

### Startup suppression

Notifications are suppressed during the initial startup seed poll. The first poll establishes the baseline — it is not a "change."

### Settings reload behavior

The master `enabled` toggle takes effect immediately (read live from shared state). All other notification settings take effect on the next poll cycle.

### Click action

Clicking a notification is handled by the OS. Future: open the activity's URL.

### `settings.toml` format

```toml
[general]
theme = "system"                         # "system", "light", or "dark"
text_size = "m"                          # "s", "m", "l", or "xl"
show_menubar = true
global_hotkey = "super+shift+space"      # Tauri shortcut string, or omit to disable

[panel]
show_priority_section = true

[notifications]
enabled = true
mode = "all"               # "all", "escalation_only", or "specific_kinds"
# kinds = ["attention-negative", "attention-positive"]  # only when mode = "specific_kinds"
delivery = "grouped"       # "grouped" or "immediate"
notify_new_activities = true
notify_removed_activities = true
```

### Per-feed notify toggle

```toml
[[feed]]
name = "Noisy feed"
type = "github-pr"
repo = "org/mono"
notify = false  # Suppress notifications for this feed
```

## Non-goals (Phase 1)

- External plugin system (WASM, JS, or otherwise).
- Windows/Linux support.
- Notification digest mode (time-window summary batching — deferred to backlog).
- Notification scheduling / DND / quiet hours.
- Notification history / log.
- Persistent storage beyond config files.

## Panel

The panel is a floating, keyboard-centric window opened via a global hotkey. It coexists with the menubar panel — both remain accessible.

### Activation

- **Global hotkey**: Configurable shortcut (default: ⌘+Shift+Space) toggles the panel (press again to hide). The shortcut can be changed or cleared in Settings > General > Keyboard.
- **App reopen**: Launching Cortado while it's already running (via Spotlight, Finder, or `open -a`) also opens the panel.

### Panel behavior

- Floating NSPanel, non-activating, centered on the monitor with the cursor.
- Hides on: Esc, clicking outside (resign key), desktop/space change, pressing the hotkey again.
- State resets on each show: scroll to top, focus first activity.
- No Dock icon — the app remains an Accessory (`ActivationPolicy::Accessory`).

### Layout

Split panel (~700×480), 60/40 flex ratio:

- **List pane (flex 3)**: Full-width rows grouped by feed. Each row shows a status dot, title, and inline status chip. Full keyboard navigation with ↑↓. Accent-soft highlight on focused row.
- **Detail pane (flex 2)**: Inset background, shows the focused activity's full un-truncated title, all field rows, and an "Open" link. No feed label or status chip — the inline chip on the list row already shows status. Updates instantly as focus moves.
- Enter opens the activity URL.

### Priority section (Needs Attention)

When enabled, a "⚑ Needs Attention" section appears at the top of the list, before feed groups. It aggregates activities with `AttentionNegative` as their derived status kind from all feeds, with a feed-hint label on each row.

- Activities in this section are **deduplicated** from their feed group below.
- Hidden when there are no attention-negative activities.
- Toggleable via `panel.show_priority_section` in `settings.toml` (default: `true`). Accessible from Settings > General.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ↑/↓ or j/k | Navigate activities |
| Enter | Open focused activity URL |
| Esc | Close panel |
| ⌘, | Open Settings |
| ⌘Q | Quit Cortado |

### Footer

Shows keyboard hints and a gear icon to open Settings.

## App Mode

The menubar (tray icon + menubar panel) is optional via the `general.show_menubar` setting.

- `general.show_menubar = true` (default): Both tray icon and menubar panel are available. The panel is also available via hotkey.
- `general.show_menubar = false`: No tray icon. The app is accessed via the global hotkey or by re-launching from Spotlight/Finder.

The setting takes effect on next app launch. Settings are always accessible from the panel footer or via ⌘, from the panel.
